Hello! I'm Mohammud Tilmo. I'm a first generation recent graduate from the University of Washington, specializing in Data Science. Ever since I was little, I've always been intrigued by stories and how to creatively and concisely tell them. My undergraduate experience as a Communications major helped me understand how to do that, and now I want to be able to use my storytelling capabilities to identify and explore the things that data tells us about the world.
